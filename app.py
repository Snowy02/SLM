Excellent! Thank you for walking me through your exact Postman setup. This is incredibly helpful and precisely what's needed to tailor the code.

Yes, we absolutely need to change the code.

Your manager's API is a custom implementation. The previous code I gave you was based on a standard, common pattern (OAuth2), but your API has its own specific "flavor." This is very normal in enterprise environments.

Let's break down the two key differences and then I'll provide the final, corrected code that matches your Postman workflow exactly.

The Two Key Differences We Must Address

Token Generation: Your API sends the credentials (App_ID, App_Key, Resource) in the request headers, not in the request body. My previous code put them in the body. We must move them.

Chat Request Body: Your API requires a much more detailed JSON body for the chat query. It needs fields like profile ID, language, model, etc., in addition to the user's message. My previous code sent a much simpler body. We must build this specific JSON structure.

Based on this, here is the step-by-step approach and the final code.

Approach: We Will Update the ProdigyAPIClient

The good news is that we don't need to change anything in your GraphQueryHandler class. All the necessary changes will be contained inside our dedicated ProdigyAPIClient. This is the power of good software designâ€”we only need to update the one component that talks to the external world.

Here is the fully updated and corrected ProdigyAPIClient class.

The Corrected ProdigyAPIClient Code

You should replace the old ProdigyAPIClient class in your graph_query_handler.py file with this new version.

Summary of Changes and What To Do

Keep Your Environment Variables: The os.getenv(...) method for getting your credentials is still the correct and secure way to do it. Do not change that.

Replace the ProdigyAPIClient Class: Copy the entire corrected ProdigyAPIClient class above and paste it into your graph_query_handler.py file, completely replacing the old version.

Update Your Token URL: In the new code, find this line and put your actual token URL there:
self.token_endpoint = f"{self.base_url}/your-token-generation-url"

No Other Changes Needed: Your GraphQueryHandler class, its __init__ method, and all the methods that create prompts (run_query, explain_code, etc.) do not need to be changed. They will correctly call self.prodigy_client.query_llm(prompt), and the client will handle all the new, specific details automatically.

You are now perfectly aligned with the workflow your manager demonstrated. Your code speaks the exact same language as your Postman setup.
