Excellent. Thank you for providing the full graph_builder.py code. My analysis was correct, and your code confirms the one-pass processing issue.

I will explain exactly where the problem lies and then provide the refactored code to fix it.

The Problem in Your Current Code

The issue is in your main build loop inside run_build_process (starting on line 122) and how it calls create_class_node (starting on line 89).

Here's the flawed sequence of events for a single file:

Your code opens one JSON file, e.g., file_A.json.

It creates the nodes for the repository, controllers, etc., for File A.

It then calls create_class_node for a class within File A, let's call it ClassA.

Inside create_class_node, it creates the Method nodes belonging to ClassA.

This is the critical error (lines 113-119): For each method in ClassA, it immediately looks at its external_calls. Let's say it finds a call to MethodB which is defined in file_B.json.

It creates a new node for MethodB using self.create_or_update_node(session, external_method_node).

It then immediately creates the relationship: (MethodA)-[:CALLS_METHOD]->(MethodB).

The result: You have created a MethodB node, but it's an "orphan." It has no [:HAS_METHOD] relationship connecting it back to its true parent, ClassB, because the code hasn't processed file_B.json yet. This is why your Cypher query fails to find the repository for the called method.

The Solution: A Two-Pass Architecture

We will restructure your run_build_process to work in two distinct passes.

Pass 1: Create Hierarchy. Loop through all JSON files to create every Repository, Class, and Method node and their parent-child relationships ([:HAS_CLASSES], [:HAS_METHOD]).

Pass 2: Create Dependencies. Loop through all JSON files again. Now that all nodes exist, create the dependency relationships like [:CALLS_METHOD] by matching the existing nodes.

Here is the refactored code.

Step 1: Modify the NeoGraphBuilder Class

Replace your existing run_build_process and create_class_node functions with these new and modified versions. I've also added two new helper functions.

Step 2: Run and Verify

Replace the code: Replace the relevant functions in your graph_builder.py with the code above.

Clear the Graph: Run your script and choose "yes" to clear the graph. This is essential to remove the old, improperly connected data.

Run the Build: Let the new two-pass build process complete.

Test the Query: Go back to the Neo4j Browser or your Gradio UI and run the OPTIONAL MATCH query again.

This time, the repo.name column should be correctly populated with the repository name, because the target method nodes are now properly linked to their parent classes and repositories.
