Okay, I can provide you with detailed comments for each file, summarizing their purpose and functionality.

generate_model.py

Generated python
# generate_model.py
# This script automates the process of generating semantic models from code repositories.
# It reads a list of repository paths from 'repo_list.txt', executes an external analyzer tool
# (analyzer.exe) on each repository to extract semantic information, and then saves the
# generated semantic models as JSON files in the 'semantic_models' directory. The script handles
# potential errors during analysis, such as non-zero return codes from the analyzer or the
# absence of the generated semantic.json file.


data_structures.py

Generated python
# data_structures.py
# Defines dataclasses and enums that represent the structure of the codebase. These structures
# include nodes for classes, methods, variables, repositories, stored procedures, controllers,
# and enums, as well as relationships between these nodes. The purpose of this file is to
# provide a common, well-defined set of data structures that can be used throughout the project
# to represent the semantic information extracted from the codebase.

entities.py

Generated python
# entities.py
# This file is a placeholder for defining a list of entities, potentially used for entity recognition or extraction
# within the codebase analysis process. Currently, it's empty, but it's intended to hold a comma-separated list
# of strings representing known entities like repository names, class names, or method names.

graph_builder.py

Generated python
# graph_builder.py
# This script is responsible for building a Neo4j graph database from semantic models.
# It reads JSON files containing semantic information about code repositories (classes,
# methods, relationships, etc.) and creates corresponding nodes and relationships in the Neo4j
# database. It uses the Neo4j Python driver to connect to the database, clear the graph (optionally),
# and create or update nodes and relationships based on the information in the JSON files.

graph_builder_stored_proc.py

Generated python
# graph_builder_stored_proc.py
# This script focuses on building a Neo4j graph database specifically for stored procedure
# analysis. It reads JSON files containing information about stored procedures (name, source
# code, tables used, parameters, etc.) and creates corresponding nodes and relationships in the
# Neo4j database. It uses the Neo4j Python driver to connect to the database, clear the graph (optionally),
# and create or update nodes and relationships based on the information in the JSON files.

graph_query_handler.py

Generated python
# graph_query_handler.py
# This script provides a high-level interface for querying the Neo4j graph database.
# It encapsulates the Neo4j graph client, schema information, and query execution logic. It
# exposes methods for querying the graph, generating Cypher queries from natural language
# questions (using an external language model via the Prodigy API), generating HTML tables from
# query results, explaining code snippets, and identifying the intent behind user queries.

parse_sql.py

Generated python
# parse_sql.py
# This script automates the process of parsing SQL stored procedure files. It iterates
# through a list of folders containing SQL files, executes an external parser tool
# (StoredProcedureParser.exe) on each file, and then saves the generated JSON model
# (stored_proc.json) to the 'stored_procs' directory, renaming it to include the
# base name of the SQL file. The script handles potential errors during parsing, such
# as non-zero return codes from the parser or the absence of the generated
# stored_proc.json file.

Generated python
# procs.txt
# This file contains a comma-separated list of stored procedure names. It's intended
# to be used as a data source for identifying or matching stored procedure names in
# other parts of the system, potentially for query generation or entity extraction.

# This file contains a list of file paths, each representing a code repository.
# Each line in the file specifies the full path to a repository that will be
# analyzed by the system. This file acts as a configuration for specifying the
# target codebases to be processed.

# stored_proc_name.py
# This script generates a list of stored procedure names from JSON files located in the
# "stored_procs" folder and writes them to a file named "procs.txt". It iterates through
# each JSON file, extracts the stored procedure name from the "ProcedureName" field, and

# table_extract.py
# This script connects to a SQL Server database and extracts schema information
# for all tables, including column definitions and indexes. It then saves
# this information as JSON files in a directory named "table_jsons", with each file
# representing a single table. This script is useful for creating a metadata repository
# of database schemas for analysis or documentation purposes.

web.py

Generated python
# web.py
# This script creates a Gradio web interface for interacting with a codebase
# knowledge graph. It provides a user interface for querying the graph in natural
# language, exploring repository dependencies, viewing class diagrams, explaining
# code snippets, and more. The interface uses various Gradio components such as
# textboxes, radio buttons, chat bots, and dataframes to present information to
# the user and allow them to interact with the graph database.
