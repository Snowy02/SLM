Excellent, you've fixed the original AttributeError! The program is no longer crashing.

The new issue, as shown in your terminal, is that you are now sending the raw, unformatted data from your database directly to the screen. The application is "stuck" because it's displaying a very long, hard-to-read string that is the literal representation of your Python list of dictionaries.

Your goal is to take this raw data and format it into a readable class diagram.

The Core Problem

Your result variable looks like this (a cleaned-up version of your terminal output):

Generated python
[
  {
    'n': {'name': 'QuoteDataService', 'namespace': 'Chubb.Marketplace...', 'type': 'class'},
    'm': {'return_type': 'ActionResult<BaseServiceResponse>', 'name': 'UpdateQuoteInDCPostConversion', ...},
    'r1': {},
    'r2': {},
    'c': {'name': 'QuoteDataService', ...},
    'source': '{\r\n ... public ActionResult<BaseServiceResponse> UpdateQuote... \r\n}'
  },
  {
    # ... more dictionaries for other methods in the same or different classes ...
  }
]


You are basically doing str(result) and printing that. We need to parse this data and build a proper diagram.

Solution: Generate a Mermaid Class Diagram

The best way to solve this is to generate a diagram using Mermaid syntax. Gradio's gr.Markdown component can automatically render Mermaid diagrams, which is incredibly powerful.

You need to convert your list of dictionaries into a Mermaid-formatted string.

Here is the updated code for your elif action == "CLASS DIAGRAM": block. This code will parse your results and build a beautiful, readable diagram.

Generated python
# In your repository_action_selected_by_user function

elif action == "CLASS DIAGRAM":
    query = f"MATCH (n:Repository {{name: '{repository}'}})-[r1]->(c:Class)-[r2]->(m:Method) return n,r1,c,r2,m"
    result = query_handler.extract_result_for_query(query)

    if not result:
        output_string = "No classes or methods found to generate a diagram."
    else:
        # 1. Group all methods by their class name.
        # This is important because your query returns one row per method.
        methods_by_class = {}
        for row in result:
            class_name = row['c']['name']
            method_name = row['m']['name']
            return_type = row['m'].get('return_type', 'void') # Use .get for safety

            if class_name not in methods_by_class:
                methods_by_class[class_name] = []
            
            # Format the method signature
            methods_by_class[class_name].append(f"+{method_name}() : {return_type}")

        # 2. Build the Mermaid diagram string from the grouped data.
        mermaid_lines = ["```mermaid", "classDiagram"] # Start the Mermaid block
        
        for class_name, methods in methods_by_class.items():
            mermaid_lines.append(f"    class {class_name} {{")
            for method_signature in methods:
                mermaid_lines.append(f"        {method_signature}")
            mermaid_lines.append("    }")

        mermaid_lines.append("```") # End the Mermaid block
        
        output_string = "\n".join(mermaid_lines)

    # 3. Return the complete Mermaid string to your Markdown component.
    #    Make sure the component you are updating with 'value=output_string' is a gr.Markdown()
    return gr.update(visible=False), \
           gr.update(visible=False), \
           gr.update(visible=False), \
           gr.update(visible=True, value=output_string), \
           gr.update(visible=False), \
           gr.update(visible=False), \
           gr.update(value=None)

What This Code Does

Group by Class: It first iterates through your query results and groups all the methods under their respective class names using a dictionary (methods_by_class). This is the most critical step.

Build Mermaid String: It then constructs a string in Mermaid's classDiagram format.

It starts with ```mermaid and classDiagram.

For each class, it creates a class ClassName { ... } block.

Inside the block, it lists each method. I've formatted them like +MethodName() : ReturnType which is standard UML syntax (+ means public).

It ends with ```.

Update Gradio: The final output_string is a single, multi-line string containing the complete diagram definition. When you pass this to a gr.Markdown component, Gradio will automatically detect the Mermaid syntax and render a visual diagram instead of just plain text.

Your UI should now go from showing the ugly raw text to a clean, structured class diagram.
