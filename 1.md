Of course. Understood perfectly. That simplifies the project significantly and is an excellent starting point. We can remove the entire complex SharePoint connection phase and work directly with your local `knowledge_source` folder.

Here is the revised, step-by-step technical blueprint tailored for your local folder setup.

### **Revised Technical Blueprint: Enterprise RAG System for a Local Knowledge Base**

This document outlines the step-by-step process for building an intelligent RAG system to query your company's `knowledge_source` folder, based on the principles of "RAG-ready" data processing.

#### **Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Environment**

*   **What To Do:**
    1.  **Create a Project Directory:** Create a main folder for your project. Inside it, place your `knowledge_source` folder and create other subdirectories: `data_processed/` (for structured output), `scripts/`, `notebooks/`, and `models/`.
    2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment:** Use `venv` or `conda` within your project directory to create an isolated Python environment. This is non-negotiable for managing dependencies.
    3.  **Initialize Git & `requirements.txt`:** Use version control from day one. As you install libraries, immediately update `requirements.txt` using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

*   **Why This Is the Best Approach:** A clean, organized, and reproducible environment is the foundation of any successful software project. It prevents dependency conflicts, enables collaboration, and makes future deployment significantly easier.

*   **Recommended Tools & Libraries:**
    *   **Environment:** Python's built-in `venv`
    *   **Version Control:** `git`

#### **Phase 2: Local Data Discovery (Replaces SharePoint Ingestion)**

*   **What To Do:**
    1.  **Write a Discovery Script:** In your `scripts/` folder, create a Python script (e.g., `discover_files.py`).
    2.  **Recursively Scan the Directory:** Use Python's built-in `pathlib` module to walk through the entire `knowledge_source` directory and all its subdirectories.
    3.  **Collect File Paths:** The script should identify all files and generate a list of their full paths. You can add logic to filter for specific file extensions you want to process (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, etc.).

    *Example Code Snippet for your script:*
    ```python
    from pathlib import Path

    def find_all_files(directory: str):
        """Finds all files in a directory and its subdirectories."""
        source_path = Path(directory)
        # Using rglob('*') to find all files recursively
        all_files = [str(file) for file in source_path.rglob('*') if file.is_file()]
        return all_files

    # In your main script:
    # file_paths = find_all_files("./knowledge_source")
    # print(f"Found {len(file_paths)} files to process.")
    ```

*   **Why This Is the Best Approach:** This is the simplest and most direct way to get a complete inventory of your local data. It uses standard Python libraries, is extremely fast, and requires no external connections or authentication.

*   **Recommended Tools & Libraries:**
    *   **File System Interaction:** Python's `pathlib` module (modern and object-oriented) or the `os.walk()` function.

#### **Phase 3: The Preprocessing Pipeline ("Transform → Partition → Structure")**

*This phase remains the heart of the project. The input is now the list of file paths from Phase 2.*

*   **What To Do:**
    1.  **Leverage `unstructured` for Universal Parsing:** For each file path discovered in Phase 2, use the **open-source `unstructured` library** to process the file. This single library will handle the entire diverse set of formats: `.pptx`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.html`, `.md`, `.xml`, etc., all locally on your machine.
    2.  **Partition into Logical Elements:** `unstructured` will automatically partition documents into meaningful "elements" like `Title`, `NarrativeText`, `ListItem`, `Image`, and `Table`, capturing the document's intrinsic structure.
    3.  **Extract Rich Metadata:** For each element, `unstructured` provides critical metadata like the source filename, page number, and element type.
    4.  **Structure the Output:** For each source file, write the partitioned elements to a structured JSON file in your `data_processed/` directory. Each JSON will be a list of element objects, making it machine-readable for the next steps.

*   **Why This Is the Best Approach:** This is the most efficient and effective way to handle heterogeneous data locally. You avoid writing dozens of brittle, custom parsers. The element-based, metadata-rich output is the perfect raw material for high-quality cleaning and chunking.

*   **Recommended Tools & Libraries:**
    *   **Core Library:** `unstructured`. Install it with extras: `pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"`.
    *   **OCR Engine:** Install a system dependency like `tesseract-ocr` for `unstructured` to use for scanned PDFs or images.

#### **Phase 4: Curation and Smart Chunking ("Clean → Chunk")**

*   **What To Do:**
    1.  **Clean Based on Metadata:** Iterate through the structured JSON elements from Phase 3. Write a script to programmatically remove noise (e.g., discard `Footer` or `Header` elements).
    2.  **Implement "Smart Chunking":** Use the partitioned elements to create semantically coherent chunks. The `chunk_by_title` strategy is excellent: start a new chunk for every `Title` element and group all subsequent content with it.
    3.  **Annotate Final Chunks:** Each final chunk must be stored as an object containing its text and a rich metadata dictionary. **This is where the local file path becomes critical:**
        *   `text_content`: The combined text of the elements in the chunk.
        *   `metadata`: A dictionary including:
            *   **`source_filepath`**: The full path to the original file (e.g., `"knowledge_source/team_docs/project_x/design.pptx"`).
            *   **`document_tree_id`**: The directory path, capturing the hierarchy (e.g., `"knowledge_source/team_docs/project_x/"`).
            *   `page_numbers`: A list of page/slide numbers the chunk spans.

*   **Why This Is the Best Approach:** Smart-chunking drastically improves RAG performance. The local file path in the metadata is crucial for traceability and allows the final application to point users directly to the source document on the shared drive.

*   **Recommended Tools & Libraries:**
    *   Custom Python scripts. The `unstructured` library also has built-in chunking functions (`unstructured.chunking.by_title`) that you can use directly on the list of elements.

#### **Phase 5 & 6: Embedding, Indexing, LLM Selection & RAG Implementation**

*These phases remain unchanged, as they operate on the processed chunks, independent of the original data source.*

*   **Phase 5: Embedding & Indexing:**
    *   **Action:** Select a self-hostable embedding model (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for speed, `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` for performance). Convert your chunks into vector embeddings. Index the embeddings and their associated metadata into a local vector database like `ChromaDB` or `Qdrant`.
*   **Phase 6: LLM Selection & RAG Implementation:**
    *   **Action:** Set up a self-hosted LLM like `Mistral-7B-Instruct` using an inference server like `Ollama`. Implement the RAG query loop:
        1.  Embed the user's question.
        2.  Search the vector database for relevant chunks.
        3.  Construct a prompt with the retrieved context.
        4.  Call your local LLM API.
        5.  Return the answer along with the `source_filepath` from the metadata as a citation.
