Of course. Excellent work getting the first two phases set up. Having the list of file paths is the perfect foundation for this next, crucial stage.

Let's dive into Phase 3: The Preprocessing Pipeline ("Transform → Partition → Structure").

The goal of this phase is to take each raw file path from your file_paths.txt, read the document (no matter its type), and convert it into a single, standardized, structured format (JSON). This structured data will contain not just the text, but also rich metadata about its role and location in the original document.

Step 1: Installing the Necessary Libraries

Before we write any code, we need to install the tools. The primary tool is the open-source unstructured library. We also need to install a system-level tool called Tesseract, which unstructured uses behind the scenes to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images and scanned PDFs.

Activate Your Virtual Environment: Make sure you are in your project's root directory (Fourth_task) and your virtual environment is active.

Generated bash
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate


Install Python Libraries: We will install unstructured with all its optional dependencies to handle the various file types. We'll also add tqdm for a nice progress bar.

Generated bash
pip install "unstructured[all-docs]" tqdm
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Why unstructured[all-docs]? This command installs the core unstructured library plus all the extra dependencies needed to parse PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoints, Excel files, and more. It's the most convenient way to ensure you can handle everything in your knowledge_source folder.

Why tqdm? This is a simple utility that creates a progress bar for our processing loop. When you're processing hundreds of files, this is invaluable for knowing how long the script will take.

Install Tesseract OCR Engine (System Level): This is a critical step and is not a Python package. You must install it on your operating system. unstructured will automatically find and use it when it encounters a scanned document.

On Windows: Download and run the installer from the official Tesseract project. During installation, make sure to add it to your system's PATH.

Tesseract at UB Mannheim (recommended for Windows): https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

On macOS: Use Homebrew.

Generated bash
brew install tesseract
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

On Ubuntu/Debian Linux: Use apt.

Generated bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Update requirements.txt: Now that the installations are done, update your requirements file.

Generated bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Step 2: The Python Script for Processing

Now, let's create the script that does the heavy lifting. In your scripts/ folder, create a new file named process_documents.py.

Below is the fully working code. Copy and paste this into process_documents.py.

Generated python
# In scripts/process_documents.py

import json
from pathlib import Path
from unstructured.partition.auto import partition
from tqdm import tqdm

# --- Configuration ---
# Define the root path of your project
# This assumes your script is in a 'scripts' subfolder
PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent

# Define the input file containing the list of document paths
INPUT_FILE_LIST = PROJECT_ROOT / "scripts" / "file_paths.txt"

# Define the directory where structured JSON outputs will be saved
OUTPUT_DIR = PROJECT_ROOT / "data_processed"

def process_all_documents():
    """
    Reads a list of file paths, processes each file using unstructured,
    and saves the structured output as a JSON file.
    """
    print("--- Starting Phase 3: Document Processing ---")

    # 1. Create the output directory if it doesn't exist
    OUTPUT_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    print(f"Output directory created at: {OUTPUT_DIR}")

    # 2. Read the list of file paths to process
    with open(INPUT_FILE_LIST, "r") as f:
        file_paths = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]
    
    print(f"Found {len(file_paths)} files to process from {INPUT_FILE_LIST.name}")

    # 3. Process each file one by one
    success_count = 0
    error_count = 0
    
    # Using tqdm for a progress bar
    for file_path_str in tqdm(file_paths, desc="Processing files"):
        file_path = Path(file_path_str)
        
        # Check if the file actually exists before processing
        if not file_path.exists():
            print(f" [ERROR] File not found, skipping: {file_path_str}")
            error_count += 1
            continue

        # Define a unique name for the output JSON file
        # Example: knowledge_source/team_a/report.pdf -> team_a_report.json
        relative_path = file_path.relative_to(PROJECT_ROOT)
        output_filename = "_".join(relative_path.parts) + ".json"
        output_path = OUTPUT_DIR / output_filename

        try:
            # THIS IS THE CORE OF THE SCRIPT
            # Use unstructured's 'partition' to automatically handle any file type
            elements = partition(filename=str(file_path))

            # Convert the list of Element objects to a list of dictionaries
            # This makes it compatible with JSON serialization
            dict_elements = [el.to_dict() for el in elements]

            # Save the structured data as a JSON file
            with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                json.dump(dict_elements, f, indent=4)
            
            success_count += 1

        except Exception as e:
            # A robust script doesn't crash on a single bad file
            print(f" [ERROR] Failed to process {file_path_str}: {e}")
            error_count += 1

    print("\n--- Processing Complete ---")
    print(f"Successfully processed: {success_count} files")
    print(f"Failed to process: {error_count} files")
    print(f"Structured JSON output saved in: {OUTPUT_DIR}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    process_all_documents()
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Step 3: How to Run the Script

Make sure your virtual environment is still active.

Your terminal's current directory should be the project root (Fourth_task).

Run the script from the root directory like this:

Generated bash
python scripts/process_documents.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

You will see output that looks something like this, including a progress bar:

Generated code
--- Starting Phase 3: Document Processing ---
Output directory created at: /path/to/your/Fourth_task/data_processed
Found 15 files to process from file_paths.txt
Processing files: 100%|██████████| 15/15 [01:30<00:00,  6.00s/it]

--- Processing Complete ---
Successfully processed: 14 files
Failed to process: 1 files
Structured JSON output saved in: /path/to/your/Fourth_task/data_processed
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Step 4: What to Expect (The Output)

After the script finishes, go into your data_processed folder. You will see a collection of .json files. Each one corresponds to an original document from your knowledge_source folder.

If you open one of these JSON files (e.g., knowledge_source_team_a_report.pdf.json), you will see a list of objects. Each object represents a single "element" that unstructured identified.

Here is an example of what one element inside the JSON file might look like:

Generated json
[
    // ... other elements
    {
        "type": "Title",
        "text": "Quarterly Performance Review Q2 2024",
        "metadata": {
            "filetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation",
            "page_number": 1,
            "filename": "Q2_Review.pptx",
            "category": "Title"
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "NarrativeText",
        "text": "This report summarizes the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the second quarter of the 2024 fiscal year.",
        "metadata": {
            "filetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation",
            "page_number": 1,
            "filename": "Q2_Review.pptx",
            "category": "NarrativeText"
        }
    }
    // ... many more elements
]
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Json
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

You have now successfully transformed your unstructured, multi-format documents into a clean, consistent, and machine-readable format. This structured data is the perfect foundation for the next phase: Curation and Smart Chunking.
