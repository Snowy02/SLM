Of course! This is a fantastic project. A 4-slide limit is tight, but it forces you to be concise and impactful. Here is a structured plan for your presentation, ordering the content logically to tell a compelling story.

Here‚Äôs the slide-by-slide breakdown:

Slide 1: The Problem & The Opportunity

Goal: Immediately grab your audience's attention by defining the business pain point and the value of solving it.

Title: Unlocking Enterprise Knowledge: From Siloed Data to Actionable Insights

(Split the slide into two columns)

The Problem: Knowledge is Trapped	The Opportunity: Business Value
üìù Fragmented Knowledge: Critical information is scattered across GitHub (code) and SharePoint (docs, diagrams, videos).	üöÄ Accelerate Onboarding: New engineers can understand complex systems in days, not months.
üîç Inefficient Discovery: Developers waste hours searching for answers, slowing down development and debugging.	üí° Boost Productivity: Reduce time spent searching by up to 75%, allowing developers to focus on building features.
‚ö†Ô∏è High Risk of Errors: Lack of visibility into cross-repository dependencies leads to unexpected bugs and system failures.	üõ°Ô∏è Mitigate Risk: Proactively identify the impact of code changes across the entire organization before they are deployed.
üìâ Knowledge Drain: When experts leave, their institutional knowledge is lost, creating a significant gap.	üß† Retain Institutional Memory: Create a living, searchable knowledge base that grows with the company.
Slide 2: Our Solution: A Code-Aware Knowledge Engine

Goal: Show them what you've built. Focus on the architecture and the tangible features you've already delivered.

Title: Building the "Brain": How We Connect Code and Queries

(Use a simple flowchart at the top and list features below)

Core Architecture:
GitHub Repos ‚ûî Generate ASTs ‚ûî Build Code Knowledge Graph (Neo4j) ‚ûî Prodigy API (LLM) ‚ûî Dual-Mode UI

Progress & Key Features Delivered:

Deep Code Understanding:

Generated Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to analyze code at a structural level.

Built a Code Knowledge Graph in Neo4j to map all functions, files, and their relationships (calls, imports).

Interactive & Intelligent UI:

Guided Mode: Step-by-step exploration for new users (List Repos ‚ûî List Classes ‚ûî Show Methods ‚ûî Explain Code).

Expert Mode: A natural language chat interface for complex, free-form queries.

Dependency Mapping: Instantly visualize dependencies for a specific repository or class.

Performance Breakthrough:

Upgraded from a slow, self-hosted model (15-minute queries) to a high-performance API, enabling real-time answers in seconds.

Slide 3: The Future: An Enterprise-Wide Digital Co-Pilot

Goal: This is where you get creative and show your vision. Paint a picture of what this tool could become at an enterprise scale.

Title: Beyond Code: The Vision for an Enterprise "Digital Twin"

From a Code Explainer to a Strategic Asset:

Phase 1: Unify ALL Knowledge (The Full Picture)

Ingest Everything: Integrate SharePoint to parse PPTs, PDFs, Word Docs, Visio diagrams, and even video transcripts.

Connect Code to Docs: The knowledge graph will link a function not just to other functions, but to its design document, architecture diagram, and training video.

User Query: "Show me the architecture diagram related to the PaymentGateway service and explain the processTransaction method."

Phase 2: Proactive Intelligence (Predict and Prevent)

Automated Impact Analysis: Before a developer merges code, the system automatically reports: "This change to the 'Auth API' will impact 3 downstream services, 2 client-facing apps, and requires updating 4 documentation pages. Proceed?"

Security & Compliance Co-Pilot: Proactively scan for vulnerabilities, uses of deprecated libraries, or code that handles PII without proper logging.

User Query: "Find all services using the deprecated log4j-v1 library."

Phase 3: Generative Automation (Build and Refactor)

Automated Documentation: Automatically generate or update technical documentation and architecture diagrams when code changes.

AI-Assisted Refactoring: Suggest code refactoring based on company best practices and patterns observed across all repositories.

User Command: "Refactor this class to use the Singleton pattern and update its corresponding README file."

Slide 4: The Journey: Challenges & Key Achievements

Goal: Show that you are realistic, have overcome obstacles, and have delivered concrete results. This builds credibility.

Title: Our Journey: Overcoming Hurdles & Delivering Impact

(Split the slide into two columns)

Challenges Faced	Key Achievements & Impact
üêå Initial Performance Bottleneck: The first model (Ollama) had a 15-minute query time, which made development and testing nearly impossible.	‚úÖ Validated the Core Concept: Proved that a Knowledge Graph combined with an LLM can effectively answer complex questions about our codebase.
üîë Infrastructure & Access: Gaining access to a production-grade, high-speed model API was a significant early hurdle.	üöÄ Achieved Real-Time Performance: Slashed query times from 15 minutes to under 5 seconds, creating a truly usable and interactive tool.
üß© Data Complexity: Handling the sheer scale and diversity of codebases across the organization requires a robust and scalable architecture.	üë®‚Äçüíª Delivered a Functional Prototype: Built a working application with two distinct user modes (Guided and Expert) that solves a real developer pain point.
	‚≠ê Built a Foundation for the Future: Our current system is the perfect launchpad for the enterprise vision, ready for integration with document repositories and more advanced features.

This 4-slide structure tells a clear and powerful story:

Here's a big problem that costs us money and time.

Here's the smart way we started solving it, and it already works.

Here's how this solution can evolve into a game-changing asset for the entire company.

We faced real-world challenges, overcame them, and have tangible results to show for it.
