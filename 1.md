## 8. Architecture

[**Insert Architecture Diagram Here**]

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[GitHub Repositories] --> B((.NET Analyzer));
    C[SQL Server Database] --> D((Stored Procedure Parser));
    B --> E[semantic_models];
    D --> F[stored_procs];
    G[table_jsons] --> H((graph_builder.py & graph_builder_stored_proc.py));
    E --> H;
    F --> H;
    H --> I((Neo4j Graph Database));
    J((Web Application)) --> K((graph_query_handler.py));
    I --> K;
    K --> L((Prodigy API));
    L --> J;


The above diagram illustrates the flow of data from the code repositories and SQL Server database to the Neo4j knowledge graph, and then to the user via the Prodigy API.

Key Components:

GitHub Repositories: Source code repositories containing C# code. Analyzed by the .NET Analyzer.

SQL Server Database: Contains stored procedures and table definitions. Parsed by the Stored Procedure Parser and table_extract.py.

.NET Analyzer (analyzer.exe): Analyzes C# code to extract semantic information and generates JSON models in the semantic_models directory.

Stored Procedure Parser (StoredProcedureParser.exe): Parses SQL stored procedures to extract information and generates JSON models in the stored_procs directory.

table_extract.py: Extracts schema and index information from the SQL Server database and generates JSON files in the table_jsons directory.

generate_model.py: Orchestrates the execution of the .NET Analyzer for each repository.

graph_builder.py: Builds the Neo4j knowledge graph from the semantic models in the semantic_models directory.

graph_builder_stored_proc.py: Adds stored procedure information to the Neo4j knowledge graph.

Neo4j Graph Database: Stores the knowledge graph representing the structure and dependencies of the codebase.

graph_query_handler.py: Handles natural language queries, translates them into Cypher queries using the Prodigy API, and executes the queries against the Neo4j knowledge graph.

Prodigy API: Provides natural language processing capabilities for translating user questions into Cypher queries.

web.py: A web application built with Gradio providing a user interface for querying the knowledge graph.

*   **Explanation:**
    *   This section provides a high-level overview of the system's architecture.
    *   Include a diagram to visually represent the key components and their interactions.  Mermaid.js is a good option for embedding diagrams directly in the README.  Draw.io or similar tools can also be used, but you'll need to host the image separately.
    *   Describe each component and its role in the system.

**9. Deployment**

```markdown
## 9. Deployment

The Source Codebase Analytics system can be deployed to various environments, including development, staging, and production.

### 9.1 Deployment Environments

*   **Development:** This environment is used for local development and testing.  It typically uses local instances of Neo4j and SQL Server, and may use a development or sandbox environment for the Prodigy API.
    *   **Configuration:** [Describe specific configuration differences for the development environment.  For example, different database connection strings or API keys.]
*   **Staging:** This environment is used for testing changes before they are deployed to production. It should closely mirror the production environment in terms of configuration and resources.
    *   **Configuration:** [Describe specific configuration differences for the staging environment.]
*   **Production:** This is the live environment used by end-users.  It should be highly available, scalable, and secure.
    *   **Configuration:** [Describe specific configuration differences for the production environment.  For example, production-grade Neo4j and SQL Server instances, and production API keys.]

### 9.2 Deployment Process

The deployment process is automated using [CI/CD System Name, e.g., GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub Actions].  The pipeline is defined in [Link to CI/CD Configuration File, e.g., `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`].

The key steps in the deployment process are:

1.  **Code Commit:**  Developers commit code changes to the repository.
2.  **Build:** The CI/CD system automatically builds the .NET analyzers and packages the Python scripts.
3.  **Test:** Automated tests are run to verify the code changes.
4.  **Deploy:** The CI/CD system deploys the code and configuration to the target environment.  [Describe the deployment method, e.g., container deployment to Kubernetes, server deployment via SSH].
5.  **Verification:**  Automated checks are performed to verify that the deployment was successful.

[**Optional: Include specific deployment instructions for each environment.**]

**Example Deployment to Kubernetes (if applicable):**

[Provide details of the deployment process if Kubernetes is being used.]

11. Security

Generated markdown
## 11. Security

The Source Codebase Analytics project involves accessing and processing sensitive information, including source code, database schemas, and API credentials.  The following security measures are in place to protect this information:

*   **Credential Management:**
    *   **Never commit `.env` files containing real secrets to the repository.**  Ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file.
    *   **Use environment variables for all sensitive information:** Neo4j credentials, Prodigy API keys, SQL Server credentials.
    *   **Store environment variables securely:** Use a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) for sensitive deployments.
*   **Access Control:**
    *   **Ensure proper access control to the Neo4j database and SQL Server database.**  Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Restrict access to the Prodigy API credentials.**
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Validate user input:** Sanitize user input to prevent Cypher injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Data Protection:**
    *   [Describe any measures taken to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.]
*   **Compliance:**
    *   [Specify any relevant compliance requirements, e.g., GDPR, HIPAA].

**Reporting Security Vulnerabilities:**

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Source Codebase Analytics project, please report it to [Contact Information for Security Team, e.g., security@example.com] or according to company guidelines.
