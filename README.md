Of course. This is an excellent and crucial question that sits at the heart of building any sophisticated, multi-capable AI application. Your manager is right to focus on it. Moving from a single-purpose pipeline to an intent-driven, multi-purpose one is a sign of a maturing system.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of practical, implementable ideas for building a robust intent detection mechanism, tailored to your specific needs.

### Step 1: Formalize the Intents (The "Output Schema")

Before we build anything, we must clearly define what we're trying to detect. A simple "list vs. explain" is good, but your examples show more nuance. Let's define a clear set of intents that cover your use cases. This structured output is far more reliable than free text.

**Proposed Intent Categories:**

| Intent Label | Description | Example Query |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LIST_ENTITIES` | User wants a list of multiple items of a certain type, often with a filter. | “List all classes in the policyissuance repo” |
| `FIND_ENTITY` | User is looking for a specific entity or its direct properties. | “Find the file path for ClaimsManager class” |
| `EXPLAIN_ENTITY` | User wants a summary/explanation of what a single entity *does*. | “Explain how the calculatePremium method works” |
| `ANALYZE_RELATIONSHIP` | User wants to understand the connection between two or more entities. | “Which repos depend on policyissuance?” |
| `UNKNOWN` | The intent is ambiguous or does not fit any other category. | “Is the codebase good?” |

### Step 2: Choose Your Approach (From Simple to State-of-the-Art)

Here are three approaches, from a quick baseline to a production-grade solution.

#### Approach 1: Rule-Based Keyword Classifier (The "Quick & Dirty" Baseline)

This is a great starting point for a prototype because it's fast and transparent.

*   **How it works:** Maintain a dictionary of keywords mapped to intents. Check if any keywords from the user's query exist in your map.

*   **Implementation Outline:**
    ```python
    from enum import Enum

    class Intent(Enum):
        LIST_ENTITIES = 1
        FIND_ENTITY = 2
        EXPLAIN_ENTITY = 3
        ANALYZE_RELATIONSHIP = 4
        UNKNOWN = 5

    INTENT_KEYWORDS = {
        Intent.EXPLAIN_ENTITY: ["explain", "how", "what does", "summarize", "works"],
        Intent.LIST_ENTITIES: ["list all", "list the", "show all", "what are the"],
        Intent.FIND_ENTITY: ["find the", "where is", "get the"],
        Intent.ANALYZE_RELATIONSHIP: ["depend on", "connect to", "interact with", "relationship between"]
    }

    def detect_intent_rules(query: str) -> Intent:
        query_lower = query.lower()
        for intent, keywords in INTENT_KEYWORDS.items():
            if any(keyword in query_lower for keyword in keywords):
                return intent
        return Intent.UNKNOWN
    ```

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Extremely Fast:** No LLM call, near-instantaneous.
    *   **Cheap:** Zero computational cost.
    *   **Predictable:** The logic is 100% deterministic.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Brittle:** Fails on synonyms or different sentence structures (e.g., "Tell me about the `calculatePremium` method").
    *   **High Maintenance:** You have to manually add new keywords for every edge case.

#### Approach 2: LLM-Based Classifier (The "Smart & Flexible" Default)

This is the most powerful and flexible approach. We treat the LLM as a zero-shot or few-shot classification engine.

*   **How it works:** We design a specific prompt that asks the LLM to do nothing but classify the user's query according to our defined intents.

*   **The Prompt is Everything:** A well-structured prompt is critical for accuracy and speed.

    ```
    You are an expert at classifying user intent for a software engineering query system.
    Your task is to analyze the user's question and assign it to one of the predefined categories.

    <CATEGORIES>
    - LIST_ENTITIES: The user wants a list of multiple items (e.g., "list all classes", "show all methods").
    - FIND_ENTITY: The user wants to locate a single, specific item (e.g., "find the ClaimsManager class").
    - EXPLAIN_ENTITY: The user wants a functional explanation of a specific item (e.g., "explain how X works", "what does Y do?").
    - ANALYZE_RELATIONSHIP: The user is asking about the connections between items (e.g., "which repos depend on X?").
    - UNKNOWN: The user's intent is unclear or does not fit the other categories.
    </CATEGORIES>

    <INSTRUCTIONS>
    - Respond with ONLY the single, most appropriate category label from the list above.
    - Do not add any other words, explanations, or punctuation.
    </INSTRUCTIONS>

    <FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES>
    Question: "List out all the methods present in ComplexityDetails class"
    Category: LIST_ENTITIES

    Question: "What does the calculatePremium method do?"
    Category: EXPLAIN_ENTITY

    Question: "Which repositories depend on the policyissuance service?"
    Category: ANALYZE_RELATIONSHIP
    </<FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES>

    <USER QUESTION>
    {question}
    </USER QUESTION>

    Category:
    ```

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Highly Flexible:** Understands semantic nuance and sentence structure.
    *   **Low Maintenance:** You don't need to manage keyword lists.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Latency:** Adds an LLM call (though a classification call is typically very fast).
    *   **Non-deterministic:** Small chance of an incorrect or "chatty" classification.

#### Approach 3: Hybrid System (The "Production-Grade" Choice)

This combines the speed of rules with the intelligence of an LLM.

*   **How it works:**
    1.  First, run the query through the fast **Rule-Based Classifier**.
    2.  If it confidently finds a match (e.g., the word "explain" is present), use that intent and you're done.
    3.  If the rule-based system returns `UNKNOWN`, only then do you make the more expensive **LLM Classifier** call as a fallback.

*   **Architecture Outline:**
    ```
    User Query -> [Rule-Based Classifier] -> Intent Detected?
        |
        +-- Yes -> [Route to Correct Pipeline (e.g., Cypher Gen)]
        |
        +-- No (Result is UNKNOWN) -> [LLM Classifier] -> [Route to Correct Pipeline]
    ```

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Best of Both Worlds:** Fast for simple, obvious queries; smart for complex ones.
    *   **Cost-Effective:** Avoids unnecessary LLM calls.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **More Complex:** Requires managing both systems.

### Step 3: Integration into Streamlit/Gradio (The Actionable Part)

The key is modularity. The intent detection logic should live in a single function within your `graph_query_handler.py`, and the UI simply calls it.

**Architecture (`graph_query_handler.py`):**

```python
# In graph_query_handler.py

class GraphQueryHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... your existing init ...
        self.intent_classifier_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(...) # Your chosen prompt
        self.intent_chain = self.intent_classifier_prompt | self.llm | StrOutputParser()

    def detect_intent(self, question: str) -> str:
        # This function can house your chosen approach (rules, LLM, or hybrid)
        # For the LLM approach:
        return self.intent_chain.invoke({"question": question}).strip()

    def run_query(self, question: str):
        # This becomes your main router
        intent = self.detect_intent(question)

        if intent == "EXPLAIN_ENTITY":
            return self._handle_explanation(question)
        elif intent in ["LIST_ENTITIES", "FIND_ENTITY", "ANALYZE_RELATIONSHIP"]:
            return self._handle_cypher_lookup(question)
        else: # Handle UNKNOWN
            return self._handle_ambiguous_query(question)
    
    # ... your _handle_... methods ...
```

**Integration in Streamlit (`app.py`):**

Your Streamlit code barely needs to change because the routing logic is now correctly encapsulated in the backend `run_query` function.

```python
# In app.py

# This part remains the same
if st.button("Run Query", ...):
    with st.spinner("Analyzing intent and executing query..."):
        # The run_query function now handles everything internally
        st.session_state.query_result = query_handler.run_query(question)

# Your results display logic also works as-is, since it already handles
# both list (DataFrame) and string (Markdown explanation) results.
```

---

### Step 4: Handling Ambiguity (The Clarification Loop)

When your `detect_intent` function returns `UNKNOWN`, don't just fail. Engage the user.

1.  **Detect Ambiguity:** In your `run_query` router, the `else` block catches the `UNKNOWN` intent.
2.  **Ask for Clarification:** Instead of returning an error, return a specific message asking for help.

**Implementation (`graph_query_handler.py`):**

```python
# In graph_query_handler.py

    def _handle_ambiguous_query(self, question: str) -> dict:
        clarification_message = (
            "I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Could you please clarify?\n\n"
            "For example, are you trying to:\n"
            "- **List** something? (e.g., 'List all methods in the class')\n"
            "- **Explain** something? (e.g., 'Explain what this method does')"
        )
        return {"result": clarification_message, "intermediate_steps": [{"intent": "UNKNOWN"}]}
```

Your Streamlit `app.py` will display this message as a string, effectively turning the system into an interactive assistant.

### Recommendation for Your Manager

1.  **Start with the LLM-Based Classifier (Approach 2).** It provides the best accuracy-to-effort ratio.
2.  Use the **structured prompt** I provided above, as it's engineered for reliability.
3.  **Implement the routing logic** inside your `run_query` method to keep your `app.py` clean.
4.  **Add the `_handle_ambiguous_query`** fallback to create a graceful and helpful user experience when the system is uncertain.
