Excellent. This is a classic and very solvable problem. Thank you for providing the exact error message. This tells us exactly what's going wrong.

The "Why" Behind the Error

The error message "File is not a a zip file" almost always occurs when the script is trying to process a modern Microsoft Office file, specifically:

.docx (Word)

.pptx (PowerPoint)

.xlsx (Excel)

Why? Because these file formats are actually zip archives in disguise. If you rename a .docx file to .zip, you can open it and see a collection of folders and XML files inside.

The unstructured library (and the underlying libraries it uses, like python-docx) expects to find this valid zip structure when it opens one of these files. The error means it tried to "unzip" a file that it thought was a modern Office document, but the file's internal structure was broken or not what it expected.

The Most Common Causes

This happens for a few very common reasons:

File Corruption: The file is genuinely corrupt. It might have been partially downloaded or saved incorrectly. It has the .docx extension, but its contents are garbage.

Zero-Byte Files: The file exists in the directory, but its size is 0 KB. It's an empty shell with no content, so it's not a valid zip archive.

Temporary/Hidden Office Files: When you have a Word or Excel document open, the application often creates a temporary, hidden "lock" file in the same directory. These files often start with a tilde (~), like ~$MyReport.docx. Your discover_files.py script is likely picking these up, and they are not valid documents.

Incorrect File Extension: Someone saved a different kind of file (like a plain text file or an old .doc binary file) and manually renamed the extension to .docx.

Solution: Diagnose and Harden the Script

We will solve this in two steps. First, we'll modify the script to tell us exactly which file is causing the problem. Second, we'll make the script smarter so it can handle these problematic files gracefully without stopping.

Step 1: Update process_documents.py to be More Resilient and Informative

Let's modify your scripts/process_documents.py to include better error handling and pre-flight checks. This new version will:

Check if a file is empty (0 bytes) before trying to process it.

Catch the specific "zip file" error and print a helpful, targeted message instead of a generic one.

Replace the entire content of scripts/process_documents.py with this improved version:

Step 2: (Optional but Recommended) Improve discover_files.py to Ignore Temporary Files

A great way to prevent these errors is to stop them at the source. Let's update your discovery script to ignore any files that start with ~.

Replace the content of scripts/discover_files.py with this improved version:

Generated python
# In scripts/discover_files.py (REVISED AND FILTERED VERSION)

from pathlib import Path

PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent
SOURCE_DIRECTORY = PROJECT_ROOT / "knowledge_source"
OUTPUT_FILE = PROJECT_ROOT / "scripts" / "file_paths.txt"

def discover_and_save_paths():
    """Finds all files in the source directory, filters out temporary files,
    and saves their ABSOLUTE paths to a text file."""
    
    print("--- Starting Phase 2: File Discovery (with filtering) ---")
    
    if not SOURCE_DIRECTORY.exists():
        print(f"[ERROR] Source directory not found at: {SOURCE_DIRECTORY}")
        return

    all_files_unfiltered = [file for file in SOURCE_DIRECTORY.rglob('*') if file.is_file()]
    
    # --- NEW: FILTERING LOGIC ---
    all_files_filtered = []
    for file in all_files_unfiltered:
        # Ignore files starting with '~' which are often temporary Office files
        if not file.name.startswith('~'):
            all_files_filtered.append(str(file.resolve()))

    if not all_files_filtered:
        print(f"[WARNING] No valid files found in {SOURCE_DIRECTORY}")
        return

    print(f"Found {len(all_files_filtered)} valid files (ignored {len(all_files_unfiltered) - len(all_files_filtered)} temporary files).")
    print(f"Saving absolute paths to {OUTPUT_FILE.name}...")

    with open(OUTPUT_FILE, "w") as f:
        for path in all_files_filtered:
            f.write(path + "\n")

    print("--- File Discovery Complete ---")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    discover_and_save_paths()
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Your Action Plan

Update both Python scripts (process_documents.py and discover_files.py) with the new code provided above.

Re-run the discovery script first to generate a clean, filtered list of file paths.

Generated bash
python scripts/discover_files.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Now, run the hardened processing script.

Generated bash
python scripts/process_documents.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

When you run it now, instead of crashing or just saying "failed", the script will give you a clear message like [CORRUPTION WARNING] Skipping likely corrupt Office file: ... or [WARNING] Skipping 0-byte file: ....

This allows the script to complete its run on all the good files, and it gives you a precise list of the bad files that you may need to investigate manually.
