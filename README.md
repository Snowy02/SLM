Okay, this is a very stubborn problem, and your frustration is completely understandable. You have done all the right things, and the fact that the error persists for all files (even non-Office files) after installing libmagic is a huge clue.

This tells us the problem is likely not the files themselves, but something more fundamental in the environment or how unstructured is being called. The error "File is not a zip file" is a red herring; it's the symptom of the real problem, not the cause.

Let's switch tactics. Instead of batch processing, we will go into diagnostic mode. We will isolate the problem with a tiny, focused script to prove that the core library can work at all.

The "One File at a Time" Diagnostic Plan

Your suggestion is exactly right. We need to tackle one type of file at a time, starting with the absolute simplest. Our goal is to get one single file to process correctly. If we can do that, we can solve the whole problem.

Step 1: The "Sanity Check" Script

We are going to create a new, very simple script to test unstructured on a single, known-good file. This bypasses all our loops and file lists and tells us if the core function is broken.

Create a simple test file. In your project root (Fourth_task), create a new file named test.txt. Inside it, just type Hello world. and save it. This is the simplest possible document.

In your scripts/ folder, create a new file named debug_single_file.py.

Copy this code into debug_single_file.py:

Generated python
# In scripts/debug_single_file.py
# Our diagnostic tool to test one file at a time.

from pathlib import Path
from unstructured.partition.auto import partition
import sys

# --- CHOOSE ONE FILE TO DEBUG ---
# Start with the simplest file possible.
# IMPORTANT: Make sure this file actually exists!

# --- Test 1: The Simplest Case (a .txt file) ---
# Use an absolute path to be safe.
PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).parent.parent
FILE_TO_DEBUG = PROJECT_ROOT / "test.txt"

# --- Test 2: A more complex file (uncomment one line at a time) ---
# Find a real PNG file in your knowledge_source and put its full path here.
# FILE_TO_DEBUG = Path("C:/path/to/your/Fourth_task/knowledge_source/some_image.png")

# Find a real PDF file in your knowledge_source and put its full path here.
# FILE_TO_DEBUG = Path("C:/path/to/your/Fourth_task/knowledge_source/some_document.pdf")

# Find a real DOCX file in your knowledge_source and put its full path here.
# FILE_TO_DEBUG = Path("C:/path/to/your/Fourth_task/knowledge_source/some_report.docx")


def debug_one_file(filepath: Path):
    """Tries to process a single file and prints detailed output."""
    
    print("--- Starting Single File Diagnostic ---")
    print(f"Attempting to process: {filepath}")
    
    if not filepath.exists():
        print("\n[FATAL ERROR] The file does not exist at that path!")
        sys.exit(1) # Exit the script immediately

    try:
        # The core function call we are testing
        elements = partition(filename=str(filepath))
        
        print("\n[SUCCESS!] File was processed successfully!")
        print(f"Unstructured found {len(elements)} elements.")
        
        print("\n--- First 3 Elements: ---")
        for i, el in enumerate(elements[:3]):
            print(f"Element {i+1}:")
            print(f"  Type: {el.category}")
            print(f"  Text: {el.text}")
            print("-" * 20)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n[FAILURE!] An error occurred during processing.")
        print(f"Error Type: {type(e).__name__}")
        print(f"Error Message: {e}")
        # Let's also print the full traceback to get more details
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()

    print("\n--- Diagnostic Complete ---")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    debug_one_file(FILE_TO_DEBUG)

Step 2: Rebuild Your Environment From Scratch (Crucial)

If libmagic didn't fix it, the next most likely culprit is a broken installation or a hidden dependency conflict. The only way to be 100% sure is to start fresh.

Deactivate the virtual environment if it's active.

Generated bash
deactivate
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

DELETE the entire virtual environment folder. In your Fourth_task directory, delete the .venv folder.

Create a new, clean virtual environment.

Generated bash
python -m venv .venv
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Activate the new environment.

Generated bash
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Install the packages again, in order. This time, we install them one by one to be methodical.

Generated bash
# First, the core library
pip install "unstructured[all-docs]"

# Second, the file-type detection library for your OS
# For Windows:
pip install python-magic-bin

# For macOS/Linux (after brew/apt install):
pip install python-magic
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Step 3: Run the Diagnostic

Now, from your project root (Fourth_task), run the new debug script on the simple test.txt file.

Generated bash
python scripts/debug_single_file.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Interpreting the Results

This is the moment of truth.

If it shows [SUCCESS!]: This is fantastic news! It means unstructured and its dependencies are now installed correctly. The problem was indeed a corrupted environment. You can now try running your main process_documents.py script again, and it should work much better.

If it still shows [FAILURE!] with the "not a zip file" error: This is very strange, but it gives us critical information. It means something is deeply wrong and is forcing unstructured to use the wrong parser even on a simple .txt file. If this happens, please copy and paste the entire error output. This is a very rare case that might point to a Python version issue or an OS-level problem.

If the test.txt file works, but a .docx file fails: Now we are isolating the problem! Edit debug_single_file.py, comment out the line for test.txt, and uncomment the line for one of your .docx files (making sure the path is correct). Run it again. If it fails, it means the issue is specific to the Office document parsing libraries (python-docx, etc.).

Your Action Plan - In Order

Create the test.txt file.

Create the scripts/debug_single_file.py script with the code above.

DESTROY and REBUILD your virtual environment using the exact commands in Step 2. This is the most important step.

RUN the diagnostic script (python scripts/debug_single_file.py).

ANALYZE the output. Did it succeed or fail?

Based on the result of this single test, we will know exactly what to do next.
